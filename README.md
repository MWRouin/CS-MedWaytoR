# MedWaytoR

A free and opensource in process messaging library (in .NET core) inspired by [Jbogard's MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR).

Implements unidirectional In-Process messaging pattern that’s inspired by the Mediator pattern, but behaves more like a Message Bus or CQRS command dispatcher in .NET core!

## ⚠️ Under development, not yet functional ! ⚠️

Details are coming soon ...
